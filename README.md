# Hiking Weather Application
Final Project for Full Stack Programming
Welcome to our Web Application!
A fun day of hiking can be ruined if you are not prepared for the right weather. This website will allow you to search for hikes/trails of your choice or see what hikes are around you. The results will be displayed on a map so you know exactly which hike you are looking at. When you have chosen your hike click the "Get Weather" button to see the current weather.
